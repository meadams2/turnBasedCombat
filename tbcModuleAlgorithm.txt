The goal of this program is to develop a module for turn based combat. This program will contain an object called Character as well as a fight function. The fight function will pit two characters against each other. 

Create a new object called Character. 
	Define new function called _init_(self):
		self._name gets user input ("What would you like your character to be named?")
		self._maxDamage gets a positive integer. maxDamage is largest amount of damage single hit would sustain
		self._hitChance gets random integer from 0-100
		self._hitPoints gets random integer
		self._armor gets random integer greater than or equal to 0		
	Property: characterName. Takes input of the character name. 

	Property: hitPoints (integer - no max or min). Will determine how much 	damage the character can sustain. Is possible to be negative or 0. 
	
	Property: hitChance (integer, 0-100) The likelihood a hit will be successful
	
	Property: maxDamage(positive integer)The largest amount of damage a single hit will sustain. 
	
	Property: armor (positive integer) The number of hits absorbed by the character's armor

	Def printStats():
		No parameters
		Prints Character name, hitPoints, hitChance, maxDamage, and armor
		Returns characterStats

Define function fightOpponent():
	Takes character1, character1States character2
	Parses out character1 maxDamage as well as character2 maxDamage
	Subtracts armor from maxDamage. Disallows negative hitPoints
	Orchestrates series of turns and runs until one character is defeated (ie maxDamage is at 0)
	keepGoing gets True (sentry for while loop)
	While keepGoing loop:
		while hitPoints
