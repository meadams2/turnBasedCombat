The goal of this program is to develop a module for turn based combat. This program will contain an object called Character as well as a fight function. The fight function will pit two characters against each other. 

Create a new object called Character. 
	Define new function called _init_(self):
		self._name gets user input ("What would you like your character 		to be named?")
		self._maxDamage gets random integer from 50-1500
		self._hitChance gets random integer from 0-100
		self._hitPoints gets random integer
		self._armor gets random integer greater than or equal to 0		
	Property: characterName ask for user input. (although strongly advise 	they name a character "Dan the Magical Cheese Wizard"--jkjk I'm bored and 	trying to make this fun for my brain)

	Property: hitPoints (integer - no max or min). Will determine how much 	damage the character can sustain. Is possible to be negative or 0. 
	
	Property: hitChance (integer, 0-100) The likelihood a hit will be 	successful
	
	Property: maxDamage(positive integer)The largest amount of damage a 	single 	hit will sustain. (Possibly use random.randint to garner a random 	integer--ideally, I would want to specify that the minimum damage is 50)
	
	Property: armor (positive integer) The number of hits absorbed by the 	character's armor

	Def printStats():
		Takes character1, character2
		Prints Character name, hitPoints, hitChance, maxDamage, and armor

Define function fightOpponent():
	Takes character1, character2
	Parses out character1 maxDamage as well as character2 maxDamage
	Orchestrates series of turns and runs until one character is defeated (ie 	maxDamage is at 0)
	keepGoing gets True (sentry for while loop)
	While keepGoing loop:
