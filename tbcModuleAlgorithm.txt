The goal of this program is to develop a module for turn based combat. This program will contain an object called Character as well as a fight function. The fight function will pit two characters against each other. 

Create a new object called Character. 
	Define new function called _init_(self):
		self._name gets name
		self._maxDamage gets a positive integer. maxDamage is largest amount of damage single hit would sustain
		self._hitChance gets random integer from 0-100
		self._hitPoints gets random integer
		self._armor gets random integer greater than or equal to 0		
	Property: characterName. Takes input of the character name. 

	Property: hitPoints (integer - no max or min). Will determine how much 	damage the character can sustain. Is possible to be negative or 0. 
		Check if value type is an integer. 
		Else, print that hitPoints must be a number and self._hitPoints gets 10. 
	Property: hitChance (integer, 0-100) The likelihood a hit will be successful
		Check if value type is an integer.
			If the value is greater than or equal to 0, then self._hitChance gets value
			Elif value greater than 100, print that hitChance must be less than or equal to 100 then self._hitChance gets 100. 
			Else, print that hitChance must be positive and self._hitChance gets 1
			
		If not, print that the hitChance must be a number and self._hitChance gets 1
			
	
	Property: maxDamage(positive integer)The largest amount of damage a single hit will sustain. 
		Check if value type is an integer. 
			if value is greater than or equal to 0, then self._maxDamage gets value
			Else, print that maxDamage must be positive and self._maxDamage gets 1.
		Else, print that maxDamage must be a number and self._maxDamage gets 1. 

	Property: armor (positive integer) The number of hits absorbed by the character's armor
		Check if value type is an integer. 
			If value is greater than or equal to 0, then self._armor gets value.
			Else, print that armor must be positive and self._armor gets 0. 
		Else, print that armor must be a number and self._armor gets 0.

	Def printStats():
		No parameters
		Prints Character name, hitPoints, hitChance, maxDamage, and armor
		Returns characterStats
	Define hit():
		Takes self and enemy
		Uses hitChance to determine if hit lands. Hit lands when random integer (1-100) is less than or equal to hitChance.
		If hit lands, determine the hitDamage using random integer (0-maxDamage)
		Else, hitDamage gets 0.
		Subtract armor from hitDamage.
		Subtract hitDamage from hitPoints
		Return enemy.hitPoints


Define function fightOpponent():
	Takes character1, character2
	Orchestrates series of turns and runs until one character is defeated (ie hitPoints is at 0)
	keepGoing gets True (sentry for while loop)
	While keepGoing loop:
		while hitPoints
